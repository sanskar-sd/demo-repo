Introduction:
In an era marked by escalating cybersecurity threats and increasing reliance on digital services, safeguarding user accounts against unauthorized access is paramount. Traditional password-based authentication systems often fall short in providing adequate protection, as they are susceptible to various vulnerabilities and attack vectors. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) systems address these shortcomings by requiring users to provide multiple forms of identification, thereby adding layers of security to the authentication process. This report presents a novel three-level password authentication system that combines user credentials, color-based passwords, and graphical-based passwords to establish a robust authentication framework. By leveraging diverse authentication factors, the system aims to enhance security while preserving user experience and ease of use.

Studies have explored a wide range of authentication methods, including biometrics, tokens, smart cards, and behavioral biometrics, highlighting their efficacy in enhancing security and mitigating the risk of unauthorized access. Additionally, research has emphasized the importance of usability, user acceptance, and system efficiency in the design and implementation of authentication systems. By reviewing existing literature and best practices, this report aims to inform the development of a robust and user-friendly authentication system.
